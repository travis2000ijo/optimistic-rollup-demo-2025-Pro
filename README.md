## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of how theoretical blockchain scaling concepts meet the practical world of finance.

Here‚Äôs a detailed description of how an `optimistic-rollup-demo` would integrate with major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

### The Short, Direct Answer

An `optimistic-rollup-demo` **does not directly integrate with centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance or Coinbase for its core functionality.** Its primary purpose is to demonstrate scaling by batching transactions on a Layer 2 (L2) and settling proofs on a Layer 1 (L1) like Ethereum.

**The integration happens indirectly through a bridge and an off-chain automated trading bot.** The rollup provides a cheap and fast environment for managing assets and executing complex trading strategies, while the CEXs remain the on/off-ramps for liquidity and fiat currency.

### The Detailed Breakdown: The Architecture of Integration

The entire process can be visualized and broken down into several key components working together. Here is a system architecture diagram illustrating the data and fund flows:
